# - take_ticket:
#   - Decrease the number of available tickets and parking spaces by 1.
# - pay_for_parking:
#   - Show an input prompt asking for the payment amount.
#   - If the payment variable is not empty, display a message that the ticket has been paid and they have 15 minutes to leave.
#   - Update the `current_ticket` dictionary, setting the key "paid" to True.
 
# - leave_garage:
#   - If the ticket has been paid, display a "Thank You, have a nice day" message.
#   - If not, prompt for payment.
#   - Once paid, update the parking spaces and tickets lists to increase by 1.
